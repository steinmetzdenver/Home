                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The human body is the structure of a human being. It is composed of many different types of cells that together create tissues 
                and subsequently organ systems. They ensure homeostasis and the viability of the human body.</P>
                <ul> <strong>It comprises a:</strong>
                    <li>head, neck, trunk (which includes the thorax and abdomen), arms and hands, legs and feet.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                The study of the human body involves anatomy, physiology, histology and embryology. The body varies anatomically in known ways. 
                Physiology focuses on the systems and organs of the human body and their functions. Many systems and mechanisms interact in order 
                to maintain homeostasis, with safe levels of substances such as sugar and oxygen in the blood.
                The body is studied by health professionals, physiologists, anatomists, and by artists to assist them in their work.
                Elements of the human body by mass. Trace elements are less than 1% combined (and each less than 0.1%).
                The human body is composed of elements including hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, calcium and phosphorus. These elements reside in 
                trillions of cells and non-cellular components of the body.
                The adult male body is about 60% water for a total water content of some 42 litres. This is made up of about <code>19 litres</code> of 
                extracellular fluid including about <code>3.2 litres</code> of blood plasma and about <code>8.4 litres</code> of interstitial fluid, and about 23 litres 
                of fluid inside cells. The content, acidity and composition of the water inside and outside cells is carefully maintained. The 
                main electrolytes in body water outside cells are sodium and chloride, whereas within cells it is potassium and other phosphates.
                The body contains trillions of cells, the fundamental unit of life. At maturity, there are roughly 30–37 trillion cells in the 
                body, an estimate arrived at by totalling the cell numbers of all the organs of the body and cell types. The body is also host 
                to about the same number of non-human cells as well as multicellular organisms which reside in the gastrointestinal tract and on 
                the skin.Not all parts of the body are made from cells. Cells sit in an extracellular matrixthat consists of proteins such as 
                collagen, surrounded by extracellular fluids. Of the <code>70 kg</code> weight of an average human body, nearly <code>25 kg</code> is non-human cells or 
                non-cellular material such as bone and connective tissue.
                Cells in the body function because of DNA. DNA sits within the nucleus of a cell. Here, parts of DNA are copied and sent to the 
                body of the cell via RNA. The RNA is then used to create proteins which form the basis for cells, their activity, and their 
                products. Proteins dictate cell function and gene expression, a cell is able to self-regulate by the amount of proteins produced. 
                However, not all cells have DNA – some cells such as mature red blood cells lose their nucleus as they mature.

                <header> <h2>Circulatory system</h2></header>
                       <ul> <strong>The circulatory system comprises the:</strong>
                            <li>heart and blood vessels (arteries, veins and capillaries).</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p> The heart propels the circulation 
                    of the blood, which serves as a "transportation system" to transfer oxygen, fuel, nutrients, waste products, immune cells and 
                    signalling molecules (i.e., hormones) from one part of the body to another.</code> The blood consists of fluid that carries cells in 
                    the circulation, including some that move from tissue to blood vessels and back, as well as the spleen and bone marrow.
                The circulatory system, also called the cardiovascular system or the vascular system, is an organ system that permits blood to 
                circulate and transport nutrients (such as amino acids and electrolytes), oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones, and blood cells to 
                and from the cells in the body to provide nourishment and help in fighting diseases, stabilize temperature and pH, and maintain 
                homeostasis.
                The circulatory system includes the lymphatic system, which circulates lymph.The passage of lymph for example takes much longer 
                than that of blood.  Blood is a fluid consisting of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets that is circulated 
                by the heartthrough the vertebrate vascular system, carrying oxygen and nutrients to and waste materials away from all body tissues.
                Lymph is essentially recycled excess blood plasma after it has been filtered from the interstitial fluid (between cells) and 
                returned to the lymphatic system. The cardiovascular (from Latin words meaning "heart" and "vessel") system comprises the blood, 
                heart, and blood vessels.The lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph vessels form the lymphatic system, which returns filtered blood plasma 
                from the interstitial fluid (between cells) as lymph.
                The circulatory system of the blood is seen as having two components, a systemic circulation and a pulmonary circulation.
                While humans, as well as other vertebrates, have a closed cardiovascular system (meaning that the blood never leaves the network 
                of arteries, veins and capillaries), some invertebrate groups have an open cardiovascular system. The lymphatic system, on the 
                other hand, is an open system providing an accessory route for excess interstitial fluid to be returned to the blood. The more 
                primitive, diploblastic animal phyla lack circulatory systems.
                Many diseases affect the circulatory system. This includes cardiovascular disease, affecting the cardiovascular system, and 
                lymphatic disease affecting the lymphatic system. Cardiologists are medical professionals which specialise in the heart, and 
                cardiothoracic surgeons specialise in operating on the heart and its surrounding areas. Vascular surgeons focus on other parts 
                of the circulatory system.

            <section class="main-section" id="Digestive_system">        
                <header><h2>Digestive system</h2></header>
                        <ul> <strong>The digestive system consists of the:</strong>
                            <li>tongue and teeth, esophagus, stomach, (gastrointestinal tract, small 
                                    and large intestines, and rectum), as well as the liver, pancreas, gallbladder, and salivary glands.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                     It converts food into 
                    small, nutritional, non-toxic molecules for distribution and absorption into the body.
                The human digestive system consists of the gastrointestinal tract plus the accessory organs of digestion (the tongue, salivary 
                glands, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder). Digestion involves the breakdown of food into smaller and smaller components, until 
                they can be absorbed and assimilated into the body. The process of digestion has many stages. The first stage is the cephalic 
                phase of digestion which begins with gastric secretions in response to the sight and smell of food. The next stage starts in 
                the mouth.
                Chewing, in which food is mixed with saliva begins the mechanical process of digestion. This produces a bolus which can be 
                swallowed down the esophagus to enter the stomach. Here it is mixed with gastric acid until it passes into the duodenum where 
                it is mixed with a number of enzymes produced by the pancreas. Saliva also contains a catalytic enzyme called amylase which 
                starts to act on food in the mouth. Another digestive enzyme called lingual lipase is secreted by some of the lingual papillae 
                on the tongue and also from serous glands in the main salivary glands. Digestion is helped by the chewing of food carried out 
                by the muscles of mastication, by the teeth, and also by the contractions of peristalsis, and segmentation. Gastric acid, and 
                the production of mucus in the stomach, are essential for the continuation of digestion.
                Peristalsis is the rhythmic contraction of muscles that begins in the esophagus and continues along the wall of the stomach and 
                the rest of the gastrointestinal tract. This initially results in the production of chyme which when fully broken down in the 
                small intestine is absorbed as chyle into the lymphatic system. Most of the digestion of food takes place in the small intestine.
                Water and some mineralsare reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon of the large intestine. The waste products of digestion 
                (feces) are defecated from the anus via the rectum.

                <header><h2>Endocrine system</h2></header>
                        <ul> <strong>The endocrine system consists of the principal endocrine glands:</strong>
                            <li>the pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, pancreas, parathyroids, 
                                    and gonads, but nearly all organs and tissues produce specific endocrine hormones as well.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>  The endocrine hormones serve as 
                    signals from one body system to another regarding an enormous array of conditions, and resulting in variety of changes of 
                    function.
                The endocrine system is a chemical messenger system consisting of hormones, the group of glands of an organism that secrete 
                those hormones directly into the circulatory system to regulate the function of distant target organs, and the feedback loops
                 which modulate hormone release so that homeostasis is maintained. In humans, the major endocrine glands are the thyroid gland 
                 and the adrenal glands. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of 
                 study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine.
                Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of 
                intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat
                 glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen. A number 
                 of glands that signal each other in sequence are usually referred to as an axis, for example, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
                 axis.
                In addition to the specialized endocrine organs mentioned above, many other organs that are part of other body systems, such as 
                bone, kidney, liver, heart and gonads, have secondary endocrine functions. For example, the kidney secretes endocrine hormones 
                such as erythropoietin and renin. Hormones can consist of either amino acid complexes, steroids, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, or 
                prostaglandins.
                The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. 
                As opposed to endocrine factors that travel considerably longer distances via the circulatory system, other signaling molecules, 
                such as paracrine factors involved in paracrine signalling diffuse over a relatively short distance.

                <header><h2>Immune system</h2></header>
                        <ul> <strong>The immune system consists of the:</strong>
                            <li>the thymus, lymph nodes and lymph channels, which are also part of the 
                                    lymphatic system.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> The immune system provides a mechanism for the body to distinguish its own cells and tissues from outside 
                cells and substances and to neutralize or destroy the latter by using specialized proteins such as antibodies, cytokines, and 
                toll-like receptors, among many others.
                The immune system is a host defense system comprising many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects 
                against disease. To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses 
                to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, the immune system can be 
                classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus 
                cell-mediated immunity. In humans, the blood–brain barrier, blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid–brain barriers 
                separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system, which protects the brain.
                Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple 
                defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteriapossess
                 a rudimentary immune system in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms 
                 evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include 
                 phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even 
                 more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. 
                 Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an
                  enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.
                Disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when 
                the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency 
                can either be the result of a genetic diseasesuch as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or 
                the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues 
                as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes 
                mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects of the immune system.

                The integumentary system comprises the skin and its appendages acting to protect the body from various kinds of damage, such as 
                loss of water or damages from outside. The integumentary system includes hair, scales, feathers, hooves, and nails. It has a 
                variety of additional functions; it may serve to waterproof, and protect the deeper tissues, excrete wastes, and regulate 
                temperature, and is the attachment site for sensory receptors to detect pain, sensation, pressure, and temperature. In most 
                land vertebrates with significant exposure to sunlight, the integumentary system also provides for vitamin D synthesis.

                <header><h2>Lymphatic system</h2></header>
                <ul> <strong>The lymphatic system:</strong>
                    <li>extracts, transports and metabolizes lymph, the fluid found in between cells.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> The lymphatic system is 
                    similar to the circulatory system in terms of both its structure and its most basic function, to carry a body fluid.
                The lymphatic system is part of the vascular system and an important part of the immune system, comprising a large network of 
                lymphatic vessels that carry a clear fluid called lymph (from Latin, lympha meaning "water") directionally towards the heart. 
                The lymphatic system was first described in the seventeenth century independently by Olaus Rudbeck and Thomas Bartholin. Unlike 
                the circulatory system, the lymphatic system is not a closed system. The human circulatory system processes an average of <code>20 litres </code>
                of blood per day through capillary filtration, which removes plasma while leaving the blood cells. Roughly <code>17 litres</code> of the filtered 
                plasma is reabsorbed directly into the blood vessels, while the remaining three litres remain in the interstitial fluid. One of 
                the main functions of the lymph system is to provide an accessory return route to the blood for the surplus three litres.
                The other main function is that of defense in the immune system. Lymph is very similar to blood plasma: it contains lymphocytes. 
                It also contains waste products and cellular debris together with bacteria and proteins. Associated organs composed of lymphoid 
                tissue are the sites of lymphocyte production. Lymphocytes are concentrated in the lymph nodes. The spleen and the thymus are 
                also lymphoid organs of the immune system. The tonsils are lymphoid organs that are also associated with the digestive system. 
                Lymphoid tissues contain lymphocytes, and also contain other types of cells for support. The system also includes all the 
                structures dedicated to the circulation and production of lymphocytes (the primary cellular component of lymph), which also 
                includes the bone marrow, and the lymphoid tissue associated with the digestive system.
                The blood does not come into direct contact with the parenchymal cells and tissues in the body (except in case of an injury 
                causing rupture of one or more blood vessels), but constituents of the blood first exit the microvascular exchange blood 
                vessels to become interstitial fluid, which comes into contact with the parenchymal cells of the body. Lymph is the fluid 
                that is formed when interstitial fluid enters the initial lymphatic vessels of the lymphatic system. The lymph is then 
                moved along the lymphatic vessel network by either intrinsic contractions of the lymphatic passages or by extrinsic 
                compression of the lymphatic vessels via external tissue forces (e.g., the contractions of skeletal muscles), or by 
                lymph hearts in some animals. The organization of lymph nodes and drainage follows the organization of the body into 
                external and internal regions; therefore, the lymphatic drainage of the head, limbs, and body cavity walls follows an 
                external route, and the lymphatic drainage of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvic cavities follows an internal route. 
                Eventually, the lymph vessels empty into the lymphatic ducts, which drain into one of the two subclavian veins, near their 
                junction with the internal jugular veins.

                <header><h2>Musculoskeletal system</h2></header>
                <ul> <strong>The musculoskeletal system consists of the human skeleton:</strong>
                    <li>(which includes bones, ligaments, tendons, and cartilage) and attached 
                            muscles.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It gives the body basic structure and the ability for movement. In addition to their structural role, the larger bones 
                    in the body contain bone marrow, the site of production of blood cells. Also, all bones are major storage sites for calcium and 
                    phosphate. This system can be split up into the muscular system and the skeletal system.
                The human musculoskeletal system (also known as the locomotor system, and previously the activity system) is an organ system that 
                gives humans the ability to move using their muscular and skeletal systems. The musculoskeletal system provides form, support, 
                stability, and movement to the body.
                It is made up of the bones of the skeleton, muscles, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, joints, and other connective tissue that 
                supports and binds tissues and organs together. The musculoskeletal system's primary functions include supporting the body, 
                allowing motion, and protecting vital organs.  The skeletal portion of the system serves as the main storage system for calcium 
                and phosphorus and contains critical components of the hematopoietic system.
                This system describes how bones are connected to other bones and muscle fibers via connective tissue such as tendons and ligaments. 
                The bones provide stability to the body. Muscles keep bones in place and also play a role in the movement of bones. To allow motion, 
                different bones are connected by joints. Cartilage prevents the bone ends from rubbing directly onto each other. Muscles contract 
                to move the bone attached at the joint.
                There are, however, diseases and disorders that may adversely affect the function and overall effectiveness of the system. These 
                diseases can be difficult to diagnose due to the close relation of the musculoskeletal system to other internal systems. The 
                musculoskeletal system refers to the system having its muscles attached to an internal skeletal system and is necessary for 
                humans to move to a more favorable position. Complex issues and injuries involving the musculoskeletal system are usually 
                handled by a physiatrist (specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation) or an orthopaedic surgeon.

                <header><h2>Nervous system</h2></header>
                <ul> <strong>The nervous system consists of the:</strong>
                    <li>central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system consists
                            of the nerves and gangliaoutside the brain and spinal cord.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> The brain is the organ of thought, emotion, memory, and sensory
                    processing, and serves many aspects of communication and controls various systems and functions. The special senses consist 
                      of vision, hearing, taste, and smell. The eyes, ears, tongue, and nose gather information about the body's environment.
                The nervous system is the part of an animal that coordinates its actions by transmitting signals to and from different parts of its 
                body. The nervous system detects environmental changes that impact the body, then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond 
                to such events. Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about <code>550 to 600 million </code>years ago. In vertebrates it consists of 
                two main parts, the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and spinal 
                cord. The PNS consists mainly of nerves, which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons, that connect the CNS to every 
                other part of the body. Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called motor or efferent nerves, while those nerves that 
                transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent. Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called 
                mixed nerves. The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems, the somatic, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems. Somatic nerves 
                mediate voluntary movement. The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic 
                nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy, while the parasympathetic 
                nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state. The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal
                 system. Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily. Nerves that exit from the cranium are called cranial 
                nerves while those exiting from the spinal cord are called spinal nerves.
                At the cellular level, the nervous system is defined by the presence of a special type of cell, called the neuron, also known as a
                 nerve cell. Neurons have special structures that allow them to send signals rapidly and precisely to other cells. They send these
                 signals in the form of electrochemical waves traveling along thin fibers called axons, which cause chemicals called neurotransmitters
                  to be released at junctions called synapses. A cell that receives a synaptic signal from a neuron may be excited, inhibited, or 
                 otherwise modulated. The connections between neurons can form neural pathways, neural circuits, and larger networks that generate
                  an organism's perception of the world and determine its behavior. Along with neurons, the nervous system contains other specialized
                   cells called glial cells (or simply glia), which provide structural and metabolic support.
                Nervous systems are found in most multicellular animals, but vary greatly in complexity. The only multicellular animals that have no
                 nervous system at all are sponges, placozoans, and mesozoans, which have very simple body plans. The nervous systems of the radially
                 symmetric organisms ctenophores (comb jellies) and cnidarians (which include anemones, hydras, corals and jellyfish) consist of 
                 a diffuse nerve net. All other animal species, with the exception of a few types of worm, have a nervous system containing a brain,
                  a central cord (or two cords running in parallel), and nerves radiating from the brain and central cord. The size of the nervous 
                  system ranges from a few hundred cells in the simplest worms, to around 300 billion cells in African elephants.
                The central nervous system functions to send signals from one cell to others, or from one part of the body to others and to receive
                 feedback. Malfunction of the nervous system can occur as a result of genetic defects, physical damage due to trauma or toxicity, 
                 infection or simply of ageing. The medical specialty of neurology studies disorders of the nervous system and looks for interventions
                  that can prevent or treat them. In the peripheral nervous system, the most common problem is the failure of nerve conduction, which 
                  can be due to different causes including diabetic neuropathy and demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic 
                  lateral sclerosis. Neuroscience is the field of science that focuses on the study of the nervous system.

                <header><h2>Reproductive system</h2></header>
                <ul> <strong>The reproductive system consists of the:</strong>
                    <li>gonads and the internal and external sex organs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> The reproductive system produces 
                    gametes in each sex, a mechanism for their combination, and in the female a nurturing environment for the first 9 months 
                    of development of the infant.
                The human reproductive system usually involves internal fertilization by sexual intercourse. In this process, the male inserts
                 his penis into the female's vagina and ejaculates semen, which contains sperm. A small proportion of the sperm pass through the 
                 cervix into the uterus, and then into the Fallopian tubes for fertilization of the ovum. Only one sperm is required to fertilize
                 the ovum. Upon successful fertilization, the fertilized ovum, or zygote, travels out of the Fallopian tube and into the uterus, 
                 where it implants in the uterine wall. This marks the beginning of gestation, better known as pregnancy, which continues for 
                 around nine months as the foetus develops. When the foetus has developed to a certain point, pregnancy is concluded with childbirth,
                  involving labor. During labor, the muscles of the uterus contract and the cervix dilatesover the course of hours, and the baby 
                  passes out of the vagina. Human infants are nearly helpless and require high levels of parental care. Infants rely on their 
                  caregivers for comfort, cleanliness, and food. Food may be provided by breastfeeding or formula feeding.
                The female reproductive system has two functions: to produce egg cells, and to protect and nourish the fetus until birth. The
                 male reproductive system has one function: to produce and deposit sperm. Humans have a high level of sexual differentiation. 
                 In addition to differences in nearly every reproductive organ, there are numerous differences in typical secondary sex 
                 characteristics.

                <header><h2>Respiratory system</h2></header>
                <ul> <strong>The respiratory system consists of the:</strong>
                    <li>nose, nasopharynx, trachea, and lungs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> It brings oxygen from the air and excretes 
                    carbon dioxide and water back into the air.
                The respiratory system (also respiratory apparatus, ventilatory system) is a biological system consisting of specific organs 
                and structures used for gas exchange in animals and plants. The anatomy and physiology that make this happen varies greatly, 
                depending on the size of the organism, the environment in which it lives and its evolutionary history. In land animals the 
                respiratory surface is internalized as linings of the lungs.  Gas exchange in the lungs occurs in millions of small air 
                sacs called alveoli in mammals and reptiles, but atria in birds. These microscopic air sacs have a very rich blood supply, 
                thus bringing the air into close contact with the blood. These air sacs communicate with the external environment via a 
                system of airways, or hollow tubes, of which the largest is the trachea, which branches in the middle of the chest into 
                the two main bronchi. These enter the lungs where they branch into progressively narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi 
                that branch into numerous smaller tubes, the bronchioles. In birds the bronchioles are termed parabronchi. It is the 
                bronchioles, or parabronchi that generally open into the microscopic alveoli in mammals and atria in birds. Air has to be 
                pumped from the environment into the alveoli or atria by the process of breathing which involves the muscles of respiration.
                In most fish, and a number of other aquatic animals (both vertebrates and invertebrates) the respiratory system consists of 
                gills, which are either partially or completely external organs, bathed in the watery environment. This water flows over the 
                gills by a variety of active or passive means. Gas exchange takes place in the gills which consist of thin or very flat 
                filaments and lammelae which expose a very large surface area of highly vascularized tissue to the water.
                Other animals, such as insects, have respiratory systems with very simple anatomical features, and in amphibians even the 
                skin plays a vital role in gas exchange. Plants also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can 
                be opposite to that in animals. The respiratory system in plants includes anatomical features such as stomata, that are 
                found in various parts of the plant.

                <p> It removes toxic materials from the blood 
                    to produce urine, which carries a variety of waste molecules and excess ions and water out of the body.
                The urinary system, also known as the renal system or urinary tract, consists of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and the 
                urethra. The purpose of the urinary system is to eliminate waste from the body, regulate blood volume and blood pressure, 
                control levels of electrolytes and metabolites, and regulate blood pH. The urinary tract is the body's drainage system for 
                the eventual removal of urine.The kidneys have an extensive blood supply via the renal arteries which leave the kidneys via 
                the renal vein. Each kidney consists of functional units called nephrons. Following filtration of blood and further 
                processing, wastes (in the form of urine) exit the kidney via the ureters, tubes made of smooth muscle fibres that propel
                 urine towards the urinary bladder, where it is stored and subsequently expelled from the body by urination (voiding).
                  The female and male urinary system are very similar, differing only in the length of the urethra.
                Urine is formed in the kidneys through a filtration of blood. The urine is then passed through the ureters to the bladder,
                 where it is stored. During urination, the urine is passed from the bladder through the urethra to the outside of the body.
                <code>800–2,000 milliliters (mL) </code>of urine are normally produced every day in a healthy human. This amount varies according to
                fluid intake and kidney function.
